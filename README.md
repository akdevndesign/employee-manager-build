## Description
This project is a JavaScript application that manages employee data. It is a command-line interface (CLI) program that allows the user to perform various tasks related to employee management, such as viewing all employees, adding new employees, updating employee roles, and adding new departments and roles. The application uses the Node.js runtime environment and several modules, including Inquirer.js for prompting the user, mysql2 for interacting with a MySQL database, and console.table for formatting the output of database queries in a table format. The code contains several asynchronous functions that use Promises to handle asynchronous database queries and user input.
